# Trajectory of a 2-joint robot arm

## OBJECTIVES:
  - Formulate the trajectory of the end-effector of a 2-DOF robotic arm
  - Solve an inverse kinematics problem
  - Use scipy.optimize to solve a system of nonlinear equations
  - Implement and compare different methods for solving the nonlinear system by minimizing the system's residuals
